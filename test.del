is fileJobAlreadyUploaded():
		string query = "select count(*) from copy_log
		where  file_name = filename &
			status = success &
			job_id = job_id"

		return query.run()


is Job_id mandatory? Yes


Generate Job_id::
	num = select count(*) from copy_log
	num += 1
	return num


if fileJobAlreadyUploaded() 
	print("file already uploaded")
	write_copy_log()
else
	copy_command()
	write_copy_log()
